# لمسة جمال | Cosmetics Store ERP

Local-first inventory and shop operations app built with Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM. The app listens on `0.0.0.0` so other devices on the shop LAN can connect.

## Architecture

- `src/app`: App Router pages and local API routes.
- `src/features`: feature actions and UI entry points.
- `src/server/db/schema.ts`: normalized schema; money uses PostgreSQL `numeric`, quantities use decimal `numeric`.
- `src/server/services`: transaction and ledger business logic.
- `drizzle/`: generated PostgreSQL migrations.
- `scripts/`: migration and demo seed.

Ledgers hold stock movements, cash transactions, party account entries and audit events. Invoice creation uses a PostgreSQL transaction; transaction-scoped advisory locks serialize invoice numbering. Sales check and deduct stock atomically. Purchases add stock and update item cost atomically. Sensitive server actions must verify permissions.

## Install and run

### Windows customer installer

Run `build-setup.bat` on the development PC to build `dist-installer\Apex-Software-ERP-Setup.exe`. The build PC needs Node.js and Inno Setup 6, plus PostgreSQL binaries under `work\postgresql-portable\pgsql`. The installer bundles Node.js, PostgreSQL, production app dependencies, and the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime; it does not include the source tree, local `.env`, or development database. Install it once on the shop's host PC; other shop devices use that PC's LAN address on port 3001. The first launch creates a local PostgreSQL cluster, generates database and session secrets, and asks the administrator to create a password. Keep regular database backups before upgrading or uninstalling.

The installer configures one central host, but it is not a hardware-bound license: someone who has the installer can install another independent copy elsewhere. A strict one-device license would require a separate activation/signing process.

For development, the host PC needs Node.js 20.9+ and PostgreSQL; the customer installer bundles its own runtime. `start-windows.bat` starts the local database cluster under `data/pgdata`, applies migrations and launches the app. It binds PostgreSQL only to `127.0.0.1:55432`; the Next.js app listens on `0.0.0.0:3001` for shop LAN access. PostgreSQL Windows binaries are available from the [official PostgreSQL Windows downloads page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).

Copy .env.example to .env and set a unique AUTH_SECRET, database URL, and a unique SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD of at least 14 characters before the first seed. The seed creates no demo products, cash transactions, or opening balances. Install dependencies with npm install. For a fully disconnected setup on another machine, stage the npm cache and the PostgreSQL bundle locally first; runtime needs no internet once these are in place. No CDN, remote fonts, APIs, analytics or telemetry are used. Licensed Cairo/Tajawal font binaries were not supplied, so the current UI uses local system Arabic fonts; place fonts under public/fonts and wire with next/font/local when available.

```powershell
npm install
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

The initial username is admin; its password is the SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD value. For production run npm run build then npm run start. start-windows.bat applies migrations and starts the app; use Windows Task Scheduler to run it at startup. Configure Windows Defender Firewall for inbound TCP port 3001, and keep PostgreSQL bound to localhost. Other LAN devices can open http://<host-LAN-IP>:3001 on a trusted shop network.

For Docker, set a unique URL-safe POSTGRES_PASSWORD and AUTH_SECRET in .env. Set SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true only when HTTPS terminates in front of the app; use false only for a trusted LAN over HTTP. Set TRUST_PROXY=true only behind a reverse proxy that overwrites X-Real-IP/X-Forwarded-For. Existing Docker database volumes keep their initialized PostgreSQL password; coordinate any password rotation with the database before changing the compose environment.

## Database, backups and printing

Edit `src/server/db/schema.ts`, run `npm run db:generate`, then `npm run db:migrate`. The seed creates the admin role and permissions, the initial admin account, a base unit, and settings; it does not create sample financial or stock records. Backups can use local `pg_dump`; set `BACKUP_DIR` to a local drive/USB and `BACKUP_RETENTION` to the number of recent dumps. Restore with `pg_restore --clean --if-exists -d <database> <dump-file>` after stopping the app and taking a safety copy. Browser native print is available for printable pages; customize print CSS for invoice documents. Logo and product uploads should be stored locally under `UPLOADS_DIR`.

## Permissions

Inventory, invoices, finance, parties, users, settings and reports each have `view`, `create`, `edit`, `delete` and `export` grants. Seeded `super-admin` receives all grants. Every future server action must call `requirePermission(module, action)`.

## Verification

Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` and `npm run build` after installing dependencies and setting up PostgreSQL. Exercise accounting workflows against a disposable database before shop use.
